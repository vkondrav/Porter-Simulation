\section{Purpose of the Project}
\subsection{Template}
This requirements document is based on the Volere template, formatted using LaTex.
\subsection{Background}
Hamilton Health Sciences have become aware of several inefficiencies in their porter services at their Juravinski Hospital location. Porter services, in this context, are defined as the movement of hospital equipment and patient transfers from one area to another. Porters are a key  piece of overall patient experience and satisfaction; the flow of day to day operations in a hospital depends on their efficiency. Some of the particular issues they identified relate to porters complying with operational policies, as well as finding ways to better handle spikes in work volume on busy days. Hamilton Health Sciences have gathered substantial operational data on porter activity, but are lacking the tools to interpret it.
\subsection{Goals}
Our goal is to provide HHS with the tools to simulate their porter services so that they can test their own solutions, methods and make calculated decisions based on the results.

\section{Mandated Constraints}
\subsection{Solution Constraints}
Given that this software is an imitation of real-world events at an HHS hospital, and that real historical data is used by the simulation, the results produced must be accurate and consistent.
\subsection{Schedule Constraints}
Simulation Software must be completed and requirements met by the end of April 2014.  

\section{Naming Conventions and Technology}
\subsection{Definitions of All Terms, Including Acronyms, Used by Stakeholders involved in the Project}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item \textbf{HHS:} Hamilton Health Sciences
	\item \textbf{IVR:} Interactive Voice Request - phone system for requesting porter services
	\item \textbf{Porter:} Staff member responsible for movement of equipment such as beds, wheelchairs, other medical instruments and patient transfers from one location to another
	\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
		\item \textbf{Off-System Porter:} Porters that follow a strict scheduled and a predetermined set of activities
		\item \textbf{On-System Porter:} Porters that respond to ad-hoc and pre-booked requests

	\item \textbf{Event State:} A state of the porter service event as dictated by the Dispatching System
	\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
		\item \textbf{Pending:} Job has been placed in the system queue
		\item \textbf{Dispatched:} Job has been matched to an available porter
		\item \textbf{In-Progress:} Job is being executed by the porter
		\item \textbf{Complete:} Job has been completed
		\item \textbf{Dispatch Delay:} Porter states that he/she is delayed during a Dispatched event
		\item \textbf{In-Progress Delay:} Porter states that he/she is delayed during a In-Progress		
	\end{enumerate} 
	\item \textbf{Transaction Time:} the time from Event State (Pending) to Event State (Complete)
	\item \textbf{Proactive Page:} A porter pages the request location to inform the requester of his/her impending arrival      
	\item \textbf{Age of Request:} How long a job has been pending in the dispatch system

	\item \textbf{Dashboard:} Visualization of the data formatted to serve a purpose in critical decision making
\end{enumerate}

\section{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}
\subsection{Relevant Facts}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item HHS will provide the project team with available non critical data
	\item HHS currently uses a Dispatching System to route its porters to desired locations
	\item On certain route segments, two porters are required to transport the patient 
	\item HHS will provide personnel and hours for testing of the application
	\item HHS will be available to answer any queries as well as give feedback on the ongoing project milestones
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Business Rules}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)] 
	\item Each request has six event states (Pending, Dispatch, In-Progress, Complete, Dispatch Delay, In-Progress Delay)
	\item Requests are prioritized on a 0 - 9 scale
	\item There are two types of porters (On-System, Off-System)
	\item Every completed event has an associated transaction time, unless cancelled
	\item Dispatch System determines the assignment of requests by using these parameters (Priority, Proximity, Pre-Scheduled Appointment Use, Age of Request) 
	\item Industry standard for patient transport transaction time is 30 minutes
	\item Porter service requests can be made using any hospital computer or phone (IVR)
	\item Porters can be "zoned" into system item requests by the dispatching system  
\end{enumerate}	    
\subsection{Assumptions}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Every porter is equally capable of performing every task as every other porter
	\item Some of the porters use proactive paging  
	\item The majority of service requests are made through hospital computers
	\item Data is 100 percent accurate but may not represent the each situation exactly, as porters do not always follow operational policies 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Scope of the Work}
\subsection{Current Situation}
Hamilton Health Sciences are experiencing inefficiencies when synchronizing their porter services throughout each of their locations and are lacking the tools to solve this problem. The biggest problem comes from the lack of compliance and coordination of the many separate entities of the hospital body. The porters are currently being scheduled by an online dispatching system, which also tracks their progress. Although the system is very efficient at how it completes it's dispatching, it has no insight or analysis capabilities to review past recorded data. 
\subsection{Context of the Work}
HHS requires a tool to support their daily operations and decision making. The tool is to provide the stakeholders with the data and insight to complete their objectives.
\subsection{Business Use Case}
The simulation tool will be used by members of the operational management staff to trial new scheduling, compliance and overflow handling techniques in a no cost environment. Any results can then be used to reinforce arguments for making changes around the hospital.

\section{Scope of the Product}
\subsection{Product Boundary}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item The simulation tool will not model the 100\% full hospital environment
	\item The simulation will only consider the On-System Porters
	\item Not all porter activities will be simulated. Simulation will concentrate on the 6 event states tracked by the dispatching system (Pending, Dispatch, In-Progress, Complete, Dispatch Delay, In-Progress Delay).
	\item Simulation will be limited to seven days of modelling
	\item Main focus of output analysis will be porter wait times, transaction time, numbers of completed and cancelled jobs
\end{enumerate} 
\subsection{Product Use Cases}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Operational Manager has a new initiative they want to implement into everyday operation. He/She uses the simulation by changing the adjustable variables with his/her own values and executing it. He/She analyses the output of the simulation and determines if the new initiative should be implemented.
	\item Operational Manager has to determine how to modify the schedule for the porter service staff. He/She uses the simulation by changing the adjustable variables with his/her own values, importing a test version of the schedule and executing it. He/She uses the output to design/refine the new schedule.
	\item Operational Manager wants to increase operational compliance of some particular policy. He/She uses the simulation by changing the adjustable variables related to a certain level of compliance with his/her own values and executing it. Once positive results have been verified he/she shows the results to all the parties involved in the compliance policy to effectively increase compliance.
	\item Operational Manager wants to experiment with theoretical scenarios. He/She uses the simulation by changing the adjustable variables with his/her own values and executing it. He/She analyses the output data and either creates a new initiative based on result or archives the data.
