\section{Introduction}
This testing report is the realization of the test plan written for the Porter Simulation. It contains descriptions and output data for the most important tests from the test plan. The majority of the following test cases are dynamic; many have static versions found within the test plan, but their results are not as valuable, and so they have been omitted.

\section{System Test Reports}
%Specific system tests summarized in terms of initial state, input and expected output. Traceability to requirements and modules
\subsection{Input/Initialization Correctness 1}
The user clicks the Statistical Data File browse button, chooses a file and runs the Simulation. 
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
	\item \textbf{Initial State:} Uninitialized Simulation   
	\item \textbf{Input:} File path to statistical data file.
	\item \textbf{Expected Results:} After picking a file the user is able to run the simulation 
	\item \textbf{Actual Results on Success:} User is prompted with a file browser. File path is shown after selection. Simulation Starts if the file exists
	\item \textbf{Actual Results on Failure:} User is prompted with a file browser. File path is shown after selection. Simulation does not start. User is prompted with the message "Statistical Data File does not exist" if the file does not exist.
	\item \textbf{Test Results:} Success
\end{enumerate}
	
\subsection{Input/Initialization Correctness 2}
The user clicks the Schedule Data File browse button, chooses a file and runs the Simulation.
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
	\item \textbf{Initial State:} Uninitialized Simulation   
	\item \textbf{Input:} File path to schedule data file.
	\item \textbf{Expected Results:} After picking the file the user is able to run the simulation
	\item \textbf{Actual Results on Success:} User is prompted with a file browser. File path is shown after selection. Simulation starts if the file exists and is valid
	\item \textbf{Actual Results on Failure I:} User is prompted with a file browser. File path is shown after selection. Simulation does not start if the file does not exist.
	\item \textbf{Actual Results on Failure II:} User is prompted with a file browser. File path is shown after selection. Simulation does not start if the file is not valid. User is prompted with error type and location within file.
		\item \textbf{Test Results:} Success
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Event List Correctness 1}
As the simulation runs, when a job is dispatched to a porter, it will then have fewer jobs left to assign. This test shows that a Porter is able to take a job and return to a pending state.  Doing this ensures that jobs will be completed and that the event list is correctly moving porters between states. This test involves the simulation core, dispatch and export modules.
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
	\item \textbf{Initial State:} Simulation event list is generated by sampling the statistical data.
	\item \textbf{Input:} Event list is generated from jobs stored in the data.csv file. The simulation will be configured to add jobs for one day, with 30 porters scheduled 24 hours a day. See Table 3.1: Porter Schedule in schedule.csv below.

\subsection{State Change Correctness 1}
Porters will be required to change state frequently as they complete all of a regular day's tasks understaffed. Any problems, beyond the obvious delays, will result in a Porter getting stuck with a job at a particular state. This will be recorded in the output data and can be addressed.  This test ensures that  the porters return to the pending state unless the Simulation has finished.
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
	\item \textbf{Initial State:} Simulation event list is generated by initializing the simulation through the interface
	\item \textbf{Input:} Event list is generated from jobs stored in the data.csv file. Porter schedule is generated from the schedule.csv file. The simulation will be configured to add jobs for one day, with five porters scheduled 24 hours that day.

\subsection{Porter/Event Linkage Correctness 1}
Every time an Event moves from pending to dispatched, a Porter must be linked to that event. This test is to ensure that all pairings of job and Porter are unique, and that after completing a job, a porter will return to "available" and continue accepting new jobs. This test involves the simulation core, dispatch and export modules.
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
	\item \textbf{Initial State:} Simulation event list and porter schedule are generated by initializing the simulation through the interface
	\item \textbf{Input:} Event list is generated from jobs stored in the data.csv file. Porter schedule is generated from the schedule.csv file. The simulation will be configured to add jobs for one day, with 30 porters scheduled 24 hours that day.

\subsection{Task Pool Correctness 1}
With only a single porter active, the majority of the jobs added by the simulation will simply be added to the dispatcher and wait. This test is to ensure that the dispatcher holds incomplete jobs correctly and that they are reported after the simulation completes. This test involves the simulation core, dispatch and export modules.
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
	\item \textbf{Initial State:} Simulation event list and porter schedule are generated by initializing the simulation through the interface
	\item \textbf{Input:} Event list is generated from jobs stored in the data.csv file. Porter schedule is generated from the schedule.csv file. The simulation will be configured to add jobs for one day, with one Porter scheduled 24 hours a day.

\subsection{Task Pool Correctness 3}
Through the use of UnitTest in python, this test checks that the dispatcher correctly adds a new job to the Task Pool if there are no available Porters. Three specific variables are tested for: Priority Weight, Appointment Factor and the length of the pending jobs list. This test deals exclusively with the dispatcher module.
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
	\item \textbf{Initial State:} Initialized simulation
	\item \textbf{Input:} dispatcherUnit.py unit testing file %Could include source code here
	\item \textbf{Expected Output:} Conclude that the Task Pool contains one additional event as the number of pending jobs has increased by one.
	\item \textbf{Actual Output:} Run the python module: python dispatcherUnit.py\\

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
	\item \textbf{Initial State:} Simulation is initialized through the interface
	\item \textbf{Input:} Event list is generated from jobs stored in the data.csv file. Porter schedule is generated from the schedule.csv file. The simulation will be configured to add jobs for five days, with 30 porters scheduled 24 hours a day.

\subsection{Compatibility Test 1} %add info for cxfreeze
The simulation is run and compared to results computed on other operating systems to ensure it is functioning normally in the new environment. The stakeholders have indicated that they will only be using the software on versions of windows. The current implementation utilizes cxfreeze to create windows executable files. 
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
	\item \textbf{Initial State:} Unknown Operating System with the simulation accessible on local storage
	\item \textbf{Input:} 'Termination Correctness 1' simulation parameters (details outline previously under 'Termination Correctness 1')
	\item \textbf{Expected Output:} Simulated results are consistent with previously generated values
	\item \textbf{Actual Output:} Currently, the simulation has been tested on a number of systems, including windows 7 and 8, and the executables produced by cxfreeze have performed perfectly. Final output from each simulation compatibility test has been: \\

\section{Nonfunctional Test Reports}
\subsection{Usability Test 1}
End user is provided with a set of instructions from the user manual on how to initialize and run the simulation. The success of this test is determined by how much external assistance the End User requires from the development team on their first use of the software. 
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
	\item \textbf{Initial State:} Simulation prior to execution
	\item \textbf{Input:} End user with a copy of both the simulation software package and accompanying user manual.
	\item \textbf{Expected Output:} The end user successfully Initializes the Simulation
	\item \textbf{Actual Output:} The simulation is yet to be formally tested with stakeholders in regards to the scope of this test case. However, feedback has been gathered during project demos with a few key stakeholders, and the responses have been positive. This test will become critical during the very final stages of development, as the interface for the project is being tailored to the stakeholder's needs.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Performance Test 1}
The project stakeholders have placed a loose time limit on the duration of execution for a single simulation run of fifteen minutes. No correct simulation execution has taken longer than five minutes, with most between one and two minutes, but ensuring this general timing for the simulation across all applicable systems is the purpose of this test.
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
	\item \textbf{Initial State:} Simulation prior to execution 
	\item \textbf{Input:} Any combination of inputs that the interface will accept and begin simulating
	\item \textbf{Expected Output:} The simulation completes execution taking between thirty seconds and five minutes, repeated thrice for consistency.
	\item \textbf{Actual Output:}

\section{Summary}
%Changes made as a result of testing, talk about automated testing
Over the past few weeks, our implementation has been dramatically overhauled, resulting in brand new methods for importing and information handling. At the current state of development, the previously defined automated testing techniques were no longer applicable, and have been omitted from this report. Approaching the final implementation, the project team anticipates that a number of automated tests will be re-added to the test plan and report. 
\\
These test cases, whether performed as a formal testing suite or quick samples during implementation changes, have provided useful information for repairing or improving the simulation software. Many of these tests have produced expected results without fail, but they provide essential security by repeatedly checking the core features of the software, ensuring accuracy throughout development.   One test in particular, Task Pool Correctness 1, which overloads a single porter with many tasks to test the dispatcher's ability to store pending jobs, highlighted a major problem with how jobs were dispatched. Jobs from the beginning of a day weren't being handled by a porter until the very end, this led to an examination of the dispatcher module and the resolution of the issue.
