to compile, pyqt must be installed. In command prompt type: 

| pyuic4 -x input.ui -o output.py | 

where input.ui is the UI created in QT Designer and output.py is the python destination

use a merging tool to merge the generated file and the actual GUI file

note: this will overwrite everything in output.py
