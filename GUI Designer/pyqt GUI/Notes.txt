1. Design the interface using QT Designer

2. To compile, pyqt must be installed. In command prompt type: 

	| pyuic4 -x input.ui -o output.py | 

	where input.ui is the UI created in QT Designer and output.py is the python destination

	for example "pyuic4 -x mockup.ui -o mockup1.py"

3. Use a merging tool to merge the generated file and the actual GUI file from src. Keep the connections from
	GUI_functions.

note: this will overwrite everything in output.py, do not make any modifications in that file
