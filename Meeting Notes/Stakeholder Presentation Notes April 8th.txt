Stakeholder Presentation Notes - April 8th 2014

The numbers below indicate the 4 key changes the stakeholders would like to see.

User Interface - Graphs are liked, final graph is a real winner.
			   - Average transaction time seems a bit wonky, atrributed to ouliers and errors in the data.
			 1 - Add tracking for the cumulative number of cancelled jobs relating to the threshold of the porter wait time variable.
			 2 - Add pop-up when the simulation finished execution. Maybe one for the excel calcualtion too?
			   - Refine UI for more obvious explainations of each basic input variable.

Scheduling 3 - Add support for use of Porter Control ID's to log and track individual, unique porters more effectively.
		     - Corey can likely develop the schedule generating tool on his own, but we could look into it for added brownie points.
		   
Other Notes - Would be nice to dominate excel better, by making macros automatic / calculations go faster for 5 day simulations.
          4 - Add support for fixed seeds to remove randomness from the simulation.
			- Currently, if they want to simulate weekends, they will need to load a weekend data set and just sample 2 days. We could maybe streamline this, but not required.
			- Something was mentioned about delays being unified, not quite sure what was meant.
