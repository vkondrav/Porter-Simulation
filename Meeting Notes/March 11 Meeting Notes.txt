Demo / Meeting Notes March 11 With Corey and Talha

- 2 Types of users -Technical who setup and analyze
		   -Basic who just interpret or suggest configurations

Need to find out if we can automate the Excel reclculation macro.

- Information in the graphs needs more explaination / description
	- Adding average lines behind spiky bar graphs can help interpretation
	- Number of pending jobs added onto the completed job bar graph
	- Add graph breaking down job frequency (over periods?)
	- Separate data into time periods for Weekday, Weekend and Evenings

Get more UI variables working.
	-Equipment delays and separate patient delays as a factor.
	- Doctor, patient and nurse delays could be handled individually

Generating the Data - should be easy to add a modifier to increase or decrease job frequency. Including volume and intensity options / variables.

Determine High Medium and Low intensities from data.
