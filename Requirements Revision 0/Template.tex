\section{Purpose of the Project}
\subsection{Background}
Hamilton Health Sciences are experiencing inefficiencies when synchronizing their porter services throughout each of their locations. Porter services, in this context, are defined as the movement of equipment such as beds, wheelchairs, other medical instruments and patient transfers from one location to another. Porters are a key piece of overall patient experience and satisfaction; the flow of day to day operations in a hospital depends on their efficiency. The problem HHS is facing is synchronization of porter services with the existing constraints.  Porters should be able to achieve greater efficiency by minimizing client (patient/doctor/nurse/technician/etc.) wait times and reducing the total time wasted in everyday operations. Hamilton Health Sciences are lacking the tools to solve this problem.
\subsection{Goals}
Our goal is to provide HHS with the tools to simulate their porter services so that they can test their own solutions, methods and make calculated decisions based on the results.

\section{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}
\subsection{Relevant Facts}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item HHS will provide the project team with available non critical data
	\item HHS currently uses a Dispatching System to rout its porters to desired locations
	\item On certain route segments, two porters are required to transport the patient 
	\item Lab/Specimen delivery use Off-System Porters on weekdays from 8:00 to 16:00
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Business Rules}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Under their collective agreement a porter cannot be scheduled for less than an X amount of hours per week and X amount of hours per shift 
	\item Each request has six event states (Pending, Dispatch, In-Progress, Complete, Dispatch Delay, In-Progress Delay)
	\item Requests are prioritized on a 0 - 9 scale
	\item There are three types of transportation equipment (Stretcher, Zoom Stretcher, Wheelchair)
	\item There are two types of porters (On-System, Off-System)
	\item Every completed event has an associated transaction time
	\item Only Off-System porters can be scheduled for pre-booked requests
	\item Juravinski uses the Pneumatic Tube for 40\% of the lab deliveries and porters for 60\%
	\item Dispatch System determines the assignment of requests by using these parameters (Priority, Proximity, Pre-Scheduled Appointment Use, Age of Request) 
	\item Industry standard for patient transport transaction time is 30 minutes
	\item Porter service requests can be made using any hospital computer or phone (IVR)
	\item Porters can enter into an unscheduled break mode (Break3) where they do not receive any requests from the dispatch system
	\item Porters can be "zoned" into system item requests by the dispatching system  
\end{enumerate}	    
\subsection{Assumptions}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Every porter is equally capable of performing every task as every other porter
	\item All transporting equipment is in equal physical condition as other equipment of the same type
	\item Wheel Chair transport of patients is four to five minutes less in transaction time
	\item Some porters use proactive paging  
	\item The majority of service requests are made through hospital computers
	\item Porters do not abuse the "Break3" mode
\end{enumerate}

\section{Scope of the Work}
\subsection{Current Situation}
Hamilton Health Sciences are experiencing inefficiencies when synchronizing their porter services throughout each of their locations and are lacking the tools to solve this problem. The biggest problem comes from the lack of compliance and coordination of the many separate entities of the hospital body.
\subsection{Context of the Work}
The context of the work is to provide HHS with a simulation that models their porter services. The simulation is not to provide a solution but act as a tool to test new operational ideas.
\subsection{Business Use Case}
The simulation tool will be used by members of the operational management staff to model their process as per their variables and the simulation constraints.

\section{Scope of the Product}
\subsection{Product Boundary}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item The simulation tool will not model the 100\% full hospital environment
	\item The simulation will focus on the On-System Porters
	\item Not all porter activities will be simulated. Simulation will concentrate on the 6 event states tracked by the dispatching system (Pending, Dispatch, In-Progress, Complete, Dispatch Delay, In-Progress Delay).
	\item The simulation tool will only model the Juravinski Hospital location  
\end{enumerate} 
\subsection{Product Use Cases}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Operational Manager has a new initiative they want to implement into everyday operation. He/She uses the simulation by changing the adjustable variables with his/her own values and executing it. He/She analyses the output of the simulation and determines if the new initiative should be implemented.
	\item Operational Manager has to determine how to modify the schedule for the porter service staff. He/She uses the simulation by changing the adjustable variables with his/her own values and executing it. He/She uses the output to design/refine the new schedule.
	\item Operational Manager wants to increase operational compliance of some particular policy. He/She uses the simulation by changing the adjustable variables related to a certain level of compliance with his/her own values and executing it. Once positive results have been verified he/she shows the results to all the parties involved in the compliance policy to effectively increase compliance.
	\item Operational Manager wants to experiment with theoretical scenarios. He/She uses the simulation by changing the adjustable variables with his/her own values and executing it. He/She analyses the output data and either creates a new initiative based on result or archives the data.
